## Author

## Description
This application was created for the UW Coding Bootcamp and utilizes mysql databases, Express.js Handlebars, and ORM's to allow manipulation of a database and dynamically display data that is held in the database. This application is deployed through Heroku.

## Direction
The user may type in a burger they would like to eat. The burger is then saved into a database and displayed on the left hand column. The user may then "devour" a burger and the state of the burger will be changed in the database and then displayed on the right hand column. No data is deleted in the database for this specific assignment.
